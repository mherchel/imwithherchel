          <h1>Why Run for President?</h1>
          <p>BarCamp is an “unconference” – an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees – usually centered around design & technology topics. The very first BarCamp was in California in 2005. Since then, the event has spread like wildfire across six continents, and dozens of BarCamp events are held each year.</p>
          <p>Attendees help create the schedule the morning of the event. Topics typically vary from the technical (“Expanding Your Command Line Toolbox”) to the inspiring (“Restoring the Historic Depot Building”). From practiced talks (“Intro to Practical Self Defense Skills”) to open discussions (“Pitch & Connect: Pitch Your Idea and Find Partners/Developers”).</p>
